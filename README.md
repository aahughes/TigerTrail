# About

TigerTrail is a sample university student information system I designed and developed using Ruby on Rails, with features to allow searching a class database by many criteria, selecting and adding classes by each user, and viewing class information. 
I used Bootstrap to enhance the UI, creating high usability and mobile-readiness.
